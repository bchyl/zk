# ZK interoperability between chains
## a specification for a light client based on zero-knowledge proofs: sync and transaction

Plumo system's  goal is light client efficiency:

securely synchronize to the head of the chain by downloading a small amount of data and perform a short computation.

new blocks BFT consensus executed by a set of validators.
The set of validations can change based on pos ) at the end of every epoch. Each validator use public key+secret signing key  to signs blocks.

make queries to the latest state only the current head of the chain.

the adversary is computationally bounded, cryptographic building blocks relies SNARK which srs generated by a suitable MPC setup ceremony.

- verify that a quorum of â‰¥ 2n/3 currently approved validators signed each block
- synchronize only epoch-transition blocks until they reach the head of the chain
- Signature aggregation(BLS) enables replacing all the signatures with a single signature
- verifying this proof does not need to see the intermediate blocks, headers or even validator sets(SNARK).
