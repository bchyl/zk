# interoperability trilemma
## Trustlessness
same level of security as main chain)
## Extensibility
usability across multiple chains
## Generalizeability
ability to transfer any type of data supported by the chains
## Connext and NXTP: an example of a bridge protocol trade-offs and focus on solving trilemma like l2
same approach: solving the Interoperability Trilemma => solving the Scalability Trilemma

Ethereum L1: optimizes for security and decentralization for longevity and utility, cost of scalability 
Ethereum L2/sharding: then using L2/sharding as a layer on top.

Connext: maximally trustless and extensible for he most longevity, utility, and adoptability, cost of generalizeability
Generalizeability NXTP: then locally or natively verified system to be as secure as the underlying domains 

### the connext protocol stack

a consistent interface across any domain, and can “upgrade” connection to be generalized.
