# 1. Semaphore
Semaphore is a zero-knowledge gadget which allows Ethereum users to prove their membership of a set which they had previously joined without revealing their original identity. 

This gadget comprises of smart contracts and zero-knowledge components which work in tandem. 

Semaphore is designed for DApp developers (not for end-users) and it allows them to abstract their features in order to provide user-friendly privacy.

## Basic features
- generate offchain identities and add them to a Merkle tree (offchain or onchain);
- anonymously broadcast a signal onchain, if and only if the identity of the owner belongs to a valid Merkle tree and if the nullifier has not already been used.

## Semaphore permission
Acquire permissions using Acquire (1) before accessing a particular resource, and if the number of permissions is 0, the thread blocks until there are any available permissions.
After accessing the resource, use release() to release the license.

This permission is passed in during construction, and is assigned the value state, which is equivalent to state.

kind: SemaphoreMutex、SemaphoreShare、NonfairSync

## 2-2 sempahore.circom file
allow to prove:

- Merkle tree: that the identity commitment exists in the Merkle tree,
- Nullifiers: that the signal was only broadcasted once,
- Signal: that the signal was truly broadcasted by the user who generated the proof.

![scheme](https://github.com/appliedzkp/semaphore/blob/main/circuits/scheme.png?raw=true)
### inputs & outputs  
- 2 public ipnuts: `signalHash` and `externalNullifier`
- 4 private ipnuts: siblings `treeSiblings` , path indices `treePathIndices`, identity trapdoor `identityTrapdoor` and 
identity nullifier `identityNullifier`
- 2 outputs: `root` and `nullifierHash`
### code flow
- calc hash `CalculateSecret` passing `identityNullifier + identityTrapdoor` and using `Poseidon`
- calc secret hash `CalculateIdentityCommitment`  using  `calculateSecret.out`
- MT verify `MerkleTreeInclusionProof`, `calculateIdentityCommitment.out` -> `inclusionProof.leaf` -> `root`

- calc hash `CalculateNullifierHash` passing `externalNullifier + identityNullifier` and using `Poseidon`

- Dummy square to prevent tampering signalHash, `signalHash`

flow as:
- Merkle tree: The circuit hashes the hash of the identity nullifier and the identity trapdoor to generate an identity commitment. It then verifies the Merkle proof against the Merkle root and the identity commitment.
- Nullifier: The circuit hashes the identity nullifier and the external nullifier. The it checks that it matches the given nullifiers hash. Additionally, the smart contract ensures that it has not previously seen this nullifiers hash. This way, double-signalling is impossible.
- Signal: circuit performs a dummy square to prevent tampering.

# Use Elefria protocol on the Harmony Testnet
## potential challenges are there to overcome in such an authentication system
- when Authenticated using Elefria on Harmony Testnet, the page stay in " Generating witness" before submit.
- no guide for applying test coin, using metamask wallet to egister system for the first time without a test coin is not conducive to testing.
- once failed, can't authenticate again.
## improvements
When metamask wallet successfully approves switching test network, it automatically issues test coins and completes one-click interaction with the contract, allowing users to focus on the following business.
