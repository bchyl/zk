# 3-1 tornado-trees to tornado-nova
## arbitrary instead of fixed
pool will allow users to deposit & withdraw arbitrary amounts of ETH
## shielded transfers without needing to withdraw them from the pool
provide the possibility to make shielded transfers of deposited tokens while staying within the pool
## cheaper fees
uses the Gnosis Chain as a Layer2 (former xDAI).  
fast withdrawals than Polygon, Optimism or Arbitrum
# 3-2 tornado-trees
## 3-2-1 code: the process to update the withdrawal tree 
### TreeUpdateArgsHasher circom
params: 

private input `oldRoot、newRoot、pathIndices、leaves array of instances,hashes and blocks`

output hash output `out`

process:
- sha256 init with header+leaves,`hasher = Sha256(header + nLeaves * bitsPerLeaf)`
- range checkout for root
- fill `hasher` input three parts(256+256+32)，firse is 256 `bitsOldRoot` 、the second is 256 `bitsNewRoot` and the last is 32 `bitsPathIndices`
- range check on hash `bitsHash`
- fill `hasher` input three parts(256+160+32) foreach leafs information，firse is 256 `bitsHash` 、the second is 256 `bitsInstance` and the last is 32 `bitsBlock`
  
## 3-2-2 SHA256 instead of Poseidon
because SHA256 relies heavily on bit operations and requires binary inputs and binary outputs to be defined, Poseidon is generally considered more circuit-friendly.

About incremental Merkle trees, To hash two uint256 values on-chain requires 23179 for sha256, 49858 for Poseidon.
The SHA256 hash function uses less gas than Poseidon to hash the same number of values in a single function call. 

ref to: 
[gas-and-circuit-constraint-benchmarks-of-binary-and-quinary-incremental-merkle-trees-using-the-poseidon-hash-function](https://ethresear.ch/t/gas-and-circuit-constraint-benchmarks-of-binary-and-quinary-incremental-merkle-trees-using-the-poseidon-hash-function/7446)

so for this scenario, we use the SHA256 hash here instead of the Poseidon hash used elsewhere.

# 3-4 L1Unwrapper contract role
all withdrawals to L1 are sponsored by the xDai (Gnosis) team, buit they cannot subsidize our withdrawals any longer.
to allow Tornado Cash Nova to continue running, even without the xDai team intervention, a couple of smart contracts must be deployed.

using new L1Unwrapper contract users will pay for the L1 fees themselves: a part of their withdrawal will go directly to the special Omnibridge worker that settles withdrawal tx on L1.

contract `L1Unwrapper` Inherited from `WETHOmnibridgeRouter` that stores TornadoPool account registrations.

It provide methods:
- `wrapAndRelayTokens`, Wraps native assets and relays wrapped ERC20
- `onTokenBridged `, Bridged callback function used for unwrapping received tokens
