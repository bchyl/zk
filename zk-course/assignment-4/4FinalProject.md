# raw idea(incomplete)

## buy-sell using zk
One application scenario:
the user uses zero-knowledge proof to prove the purchase and complete the transaction.
But the seller refuses, or does not handle timeout, at this time the user has the right to redeem.

## cross-chain
cross-chain assets locked in the contract forever, only the user can withdraw.

## management of user assets
centralization has no ability to consume user assets.
