# ZkSync
## compiler(Solidity to zkEVM bytecode)
wish to release much more More zkEVM implementation details  such as compiler for Solidity to zkEVM bytecode at
the repo [zkEVM Solidity compiler](https://github.com/matter-labs/compiler-solidity).

how to use llvm ir framework and using its opt pass?

## plonkish(UlTraPlonk) implementation details
- tinyRAM is nataive or vnTinyRAM? how to work with Turing-complete(jumps or recursion)?
- is there some small demo for lookup table and custom gate?

## zkEVM solution advantage
- compatibility problems with EVM
- compared with fully EVM-compliant bytecode level solution such as EF's solution [appliedzkp](https://github.com/appliedzkp/zkevm-circuits), What are the advantages of a language-level solution for ZKSync2.0?

# Mina
## consensus: Ouroboros Samisika
where Mina's consensus mechanism differ from those described in Ouroboros's paper, especially unique compressed blockchain?

## dev
when trying to set up the Mina daemon often encountered problems such as sycn and snark worker.
Is there any other efficient solution besides discord and github issue?
